# About me
I am a professional specializing in software automation and testing. With extensive experience developing software test automation frameworks, I am proficient in technologies such as Selenium, Cypress, Playright, BDD, Cucumber and Specflow, Gradle, and Maven, with programming languages such as Java, typescript, C#, and Python and patterns design such as Page Object Model and Screenplay.
My background includes creating and leading manual testing processes in web, API, mobile, cloud services, and AI environments.

In addition to my experience in manual and automated testing processes, I am implementing CI-CD processes with GitHub actions and Jenkins and performance testing with Locust.
I am recognized for my ability to research and implement cutting-edge technologies and for my effective communication and collaboration skills, both independently and within teams.
